# goal

- provide a working rank choice Shiny App
  - that is backed by async SqlAlchemy SqlLite
  - and build an abstraction that makes sense for the above direct SqlAlchemy API usage into zs-state, so that it maybe proxied over the datamesh in the future
  - build as a shiny module
  - create a Makefile for easy demonstration / use, maybe with a Dockerfile just for professionalism
 
# resources

- Wally, maybe help from Ted
- all others are welcome to comment, otherwise, Wally will do the design and initial implementation
- timeline would be complete before Dec 1
